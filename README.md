## Installation
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install packages.
We've created requirements.txt with all libraries that we are going to use,
so to run the code you will need to install all dependencies from there.
```bash
pip install -r reqirements.txt
```

### In order to use TEXT variable, import that from config.py
```python
from config import TEXT
```
